# Go-Microservices
Golang Microservice making use of protobuf and gRPC as the underlying transport protocol.

I will be building a generic microservice, a shipping container management platform.

I will be creating the following services throughout the series:

- consignments
- users
- authentication
- vessels

The stack we will end up with will be: ``golang``, ``mongodb``, ``grpc``, ``docker``, ``Google Cloud``, ``Kubernetes``, ``NATS``, ``CircleCI``, ``Terraform`` and ``go-micro``.
